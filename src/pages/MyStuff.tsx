          My latest obsession (I know it's not fall yet but the
          relaxed/melancholy mood fits the feeling of yet another summer that is
          passing me by)

          If it was on spotify, this song would be #1 in that playlist!
          heartbreaking and beautiful

          Also been enjoying this playlist which I was inspired to make after
          watching the first episode of "Berserk" and loving the opening/closing
          themes so much.

          I think next playlist I should make should be songs like "Everything
          in it's right place" since I NEED to listen to that song daily but I
          really don't want to wear it out

        <p>
          I have been making kombucha since around May 2025. I want to document
          any particularly delicious flavour combinations I try out, and
          hopefully include some pictures in the future! Some of the best
          flavours so far have been:
          <ul>
            <li>apple ginger</li>
            <li>passionfruit</li>
            <li>orange ginger (with freshly squeezed juice!)</li>
            <li>cherry</li>
            <li>blueberry</li>
          </ul>
          I have yet to mess around with different varieties of tea...
